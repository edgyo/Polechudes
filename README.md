# Polechudes
Polechudes Text Game is my second project on learning Python and GitHub.

It contains a Python script with the code itself and two .txt files with all words and current game version.

### version 0.5
- Polechudes is now fully executable! 'Running game' section has been updated also.

### version 0.4
- fixed a bug when game picked a one letter word and stop
- added code comments

### version 0.3
- added 3 categories (Animals, Clothes, Fruit) to help you guessing
- improved scroing system
- added more than 1000 words

## Running game
To run Polechudes game, you need to download the folder and run the 'polechudes.exe' app located in "/dist" folder. Note that you can still run it with cmd command 'python polechudes.py' while in the "polechudes project" folder.

Thanks!
