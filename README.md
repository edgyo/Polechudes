# Polechudes
Polechudes Text Game is my second project on learning Python and GitHub.

## Running game
To run Polechudes game, you need to download the folder and run the python script in you command line with 'py polechudes.py' command.
Note that you have to have python installed and be in the 'polechudes project' with your command line!

Thanks!
