# Polechudes
Polechudes Text Game is my second project on learning Python and GitHub.

It contains a Python script with the code itself and two .txt files with all words and current game version.

### version 0.4
- fixed a bug when game picked a one letter word and stop
- added code comments

### version 0.3
- added 3 categories (Animals, Clothes, Fruit) to help you guessing
- improved scroing system
- added more than 500 words

## Running game
To run Polechudes game, you need to download the folder and run the python script in you command line with 'py polechudes.py' command.
Note that you have to have python installed and be in the 'polechudes project' with your command line!

Thanks!
